{- 1.How does the recursive version of the factorial function
     behave if applied to a negative argument, such as (-1)?

     adding a guard to the recursive case.

     returns the sum of the non-negative integers from a given 
     value down to zero. For example, sumdown 3 should return

     implements Euclidâ€™s algorithm for calculating the greatest
     common divisor of two non-negative integers: if the two 
     numbers are equal, this number is the result; otherwise, the
     smaller number is subtracted from the larger, and the 
     process is then repeated. For example:

{- 6.Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude,
     define the following library functions on lists using 
     recursion.
Note: most of these functions are defined in the prelude using 
other library functions rather than using explicit recursion, and
are generic functions rather than being specific to the type of
lists.
     a.Decide if all logical values in a list are True:
       and :: [Bool] -> Bool -}
 and1 :: [Bool] -> Bool
 and1 []        = True
 and1 [a]       = a
 and1 (False:_) = False
 and1 (True:as) = and as

{-   b.Concatenate a list of lists:
       concat :: [[a]] -> [a] -}
 concat1 :: [[a]] -> [a]
 concat1 (xs:[]) = xs
 concat1 (xs:xss) = xs ++ concat xss

{-   c.Produce a list with n identical elements:
       replicate :: Int -> a -> [a] -}
 replicate1 :: Int -> a -> [a]
 replicate1 0 a = []
 replicate1 n a | n > 0 = a : replicate1 (n-1) a

{-   d.Select the nth element of a list:
       (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
       []     !! n    = []
       (x:xs) !! 0    = x
       (x:xs) !! n    = xs !! (n-1)

 elem1 x []    = False
 elem1 x (y:ys) | x == y =True
                | otherwise = elem1 x ys 

{- 7.Define a recursive function 
     merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a] that merges two sorted
     lists to give a single sorted list. For example:
     > merge [2,5,6] [1,3,4]
     [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Note: your definition should not use other functions on sorted 
lists such as insert or isort, but should be defined using 
explicit recursion.

 merge xs [] = xs
 merge [] ys = ys

{- 8.Using merge, define a function msort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] 
     that implements merge sort, in which the empty list and 
     singleton lists are already sorted, and any other list is
     sorted by merging together the two lists that result from 
     sorting the two halves of the list separately.
Hint: first define a function halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a]) that
splits a list into two halves whose lengths differ by at most one.
-}
 halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a])
 halve xs =(take (length xs `div` 2) xs, 
            drop (length xs `div` 2) xs)

 msort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
 msort []  = []
 msort [a] = [a]
 msort xs  = merge (msort (fst (halve xs)))
                   (msort (snd (halve xs)))

{- 9.Using the five-step process, construct the library functions
     that:
